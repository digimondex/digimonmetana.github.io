While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=the-hills--eren-jaeger---𖥻𝐓𝐇𝐄-𝐇𝐈𝐋𝐋𝐒--black-art-pictures-black-anime>THE HILLS ; Eren Jaeger - 𖥻𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐇𝐈𝐋𝐋𝐒 | Black Art Pictures, Black Anime<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-hills--eren-jaeger---𖥻𝐓𝐇𝐄-𝐇𝐈𝐋𝐋𝐒--black-art-pictures-black-anime>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7f/5d/90/7f5d90bc1767f902ee4de6f75c839c86.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.xcWfU259qPSc1gHQ6ZPWEAHaFo&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="THE HILLS ; eren jaeger - 𖥻𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐇𝐈𝐋𝐋𝐒 | Black art pictures, Black anime"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Anime Characters and their Designs: Most animes feature colorful characters with distinctive designs.
