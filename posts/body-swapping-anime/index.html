While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=anime-body-swap-4---youtube>Anime Body Swap #4 - YouTube<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#anime-body-swap-4---youtube>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gBdilU19mVo/maxresdefault.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.-x9_AnLG-xFMaBWjqXQQlgHaEK&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Anime body swap #4 - YouTube"><p><em>Source: youtube.com</em></p><blockquote><p>swap anime body.</p></blockquote><p>What are wallpaper screens and why are they so popular?
